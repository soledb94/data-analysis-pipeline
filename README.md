The main purpose of this project is to test the **effect in the air quality** due to the confinement during the covid-19 pandemic.

***

Things to have into consideration:

- Just introducing a city, you will be able to compare in real time for a measurement requested how the decreasing has been about before the quarentine was proclamed. 

- It could be applicable to a wider range of cities and air quality measures by accessing the full data-set provided by the european environment agency. (https://www.eea.europa.eu/)

***

The result of this research shows us something positive in the dramatic situation experienced in 2020. It is a pity that this decrease in pollution is due to a side effect due to a mandatory confinement that we are experiencing rather than committed measures by politicians and citizens
