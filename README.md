The main purpose of this project is to test the effect in the air quality due to the confinement during the covid-19 pandemic.

Just introducing a city, you will be able to compare in real time for a measurement requested how the decreasing has been about before the quarentine was proclamed. 

This project means a test for two big cities (Madrid and Barcelona) for two clear indicators of air quality. (no2 and pm25)

It could be applicable to a wider range of cities and air quality measures by accessing the full data-set provided by the european environment agency. (https://www.eea.europa.eu/)
